## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at Seoul National University (SNU) Software Platform Lab ([SPL](https://spl.snu.ac.kr/)), advised by Prof. Byung-Gon Chun.
My interest lies in (but not limited to) building large-scale deep learning pipelines (training or inference) and developing large-scale natural language models.
I've also been participating many open-source projects including [Apache Nemo](https://nemo.apache.org/) and [Apache REEF](https://reef.apache.org/).
